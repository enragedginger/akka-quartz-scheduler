## Changelog ##

Every good library has a changelog.

## Version 1.9.3 ##
* Added support for Scala 3. PR [#114](https://github.com/enragedginger/akka-quartz-scheduler/pull/114)

* Added `deleteAll` method. PR [#109](https://github.com/enragedginger/akka-quartz-scheduler/pull/109)

## Version 1.9.1 ##
* Fixed `Delayed Setup & Execute a Cron Job` test case at `QuartzTypedSchedulerFunctionalSpec`.
* Updated to Scala `2.12.13` and `2.13.5`.
* Updated TravisCI to build with new Scala Versions.
* Added OpenJDK11 stage on TravisCI.

## Version 1.9.0 ##
* Added [Akka Typed Actor](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5.32/typed/) compatibility. PR [#102](https://github.com/enragedginger/akka-quartz-scheduler/pull/102)
* Upgrade Akka Actor to 2.6.10 version.

## Version 1.8.5 ##
* Added previous and next firing times to messages where applicable. PR [#80](https://github.com/enragedginger/akka-quartz-scheduler/pull/80)
* Updated config from val to def to allow it to be overriden. Pr [#100](https://github.com/enragedginger/akka-quartz-scheduler/pull/100)
* Upgraded the project to SBT 1.3.13 and removed some unnecessary plugins for the project.
* Some of the tests use America/San_Francisco as a timezone. This timezone doesn't exist, so some time was spent "fixing" this but ultimately the changes
were mostly reverted. Again, this should only affect the tests and shouldn't affect the library itself.
